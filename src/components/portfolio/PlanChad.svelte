      PlanChad is the Chadâ„¢ of to-do apps. It's made with React 18 + NextJS 12
      for the front-end, and uses Firebase as both the back-end database and
      Google-Auth provider. My inspiration for this project was how I personally
      like to visualize planning projects that have a large scope: I like to
      separate them into phases and assign tasks to each phase. This app is
      packed with features including two layers of drag and drop, a handmade
      calendar, the ability to share projects and assign collaborators to tasks,
      a websocket based chat system made with Firebase, and several custom view
      options.

      This app served as my front-end capstone project for a class I'm finishing
      at the Nashville Software School, and I learned a lot during its creation.
      For example, in trying to optimize how often I posted to the database, I
      ended up writing a caching system that performs all CRUD actions on the
      client, and then the user syncs their data with the database when they
      save their work. This was very complicated, and I learned shortly after
      that this could be more easily accomplished with a library like React
      Query. Also, writing the calendar was particularly challenging, but I
      learned a lot about how to manipulate data in creative, visuals ways on
      the dom.
